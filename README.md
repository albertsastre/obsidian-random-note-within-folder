# Random Note within Folder
Creates a hotkey to open a random note from within the current folder.

Additionally, creates another hotkey that includes subfolders. So whereas the first command will only consider siblings, this command considers cousins all the way down.
Keep in mind that if a note from a subfolder is chosen, the next random note will now be limited to that folder.

## Commands
- Open Random Note within Folder: (Mod + Shift + R)
- Open Random Note within Folder: Include subfolders (Mod + Alt + R)
